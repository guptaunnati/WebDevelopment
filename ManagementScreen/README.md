## Management Screen

Replicated Screen with Tech Stack (HTML, CSS, JS, Django, Apex Charts, DataTables.net)

In this project, I have replicated a screen using a combination of several technologies and frameworks. The primary purpose of the project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that displays data using interactive charts and tables.

The Tech Stack used in this project includes:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language for creating the structure and layout of web pages. It provides the foundation for organizing the content and elements on the screen.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to add visual styles, such as colors, fonts, and layouts, to the HTML elements. It helps in enhancing the appearance and design of the replicated screen.

JS (JavaScript): JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on web pages. It is used to add functionality and create interactive elements on the screen.

Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies the development of web applications. It provides tools and libraries for handling various aspects of web development, including URL routing, database management, and template rendering.

Apex Charts: Apex Charts is a modern JavaScript charting library that offers a wide range of interactive and visually appealing charts. It allows the display of data in different chart types, such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc.

DataTables.net: DataTables.net is a feature-rich JavaScript library used for creating advanced data tables. It provides functionalities like sorting, filtering, pagination, and searching in tabular data, enhancing the user's ability to explore and analyze the displayed data.

By leveraging these technologies, I have replicated a screen that presents data in a visually pleasing manner, with interactive charts powered by Apex Charts and data tables powered by DataTables.net. The Django framework facilitates the backend operations, such as retrieving and processing data, while the frontend components built with HTML, CSS, and JS handle the presentation and user interaction.

The replicated screen aims to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to view and analyze data, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the visualizations and tabular representations.
